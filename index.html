          I like team work. Got lots of experience hiring and managing teams.
          I'm used to setting and managing budgets and have a deep understanding
          of accounting and finance. Fluent in English and Swedish. I think
          using data is important to be able to make pragmatic decisions
          quickly. Considering myself an all-rounder - able to manage across
          different functions and liaise with all parts of the business. I'm
          creative, used to grind and have the get-it-done attitude. DM or
